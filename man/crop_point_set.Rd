\usage{
crop_point_set(point.set, size)
}
\arguments{
\item{point.set}{a point set as a matrix with columns x,y,z.}

\item{size}{vector of distances from the geometric median of the points along each axis. 
Points are discarded if they are outside the ellipsoid defined by size and centred on 
the geometric median of the points.}
}
\value{
point set as a matrix with columns x,y,z.
}
\description{
Retain points in the set that are within the given distance from the geometric median of the set.
Using the geometric median is more robust than using the centre of mass (i.e. mean).
